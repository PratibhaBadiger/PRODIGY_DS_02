- Problem Statement: Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset. Explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in data.

- The Data set used: titanic

- Libraries used:

1. Pandas: it is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are designed for efficiently analyzing large datasets.
2. Matplotlib: it is a 2D plotting library that produces static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It can be used for creating a wide variety of plots and charts.
3. Seaborn: it is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- Matplotlib.pyplot is used for bar plots and histograms.
- Pandas and Matplotlib for grouped bar plots (grouped bar plots are used when there is a need to compare two attributes in the dataset).
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for violin plots and heatmaps.
